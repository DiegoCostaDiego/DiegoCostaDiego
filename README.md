# Hi, I'm Diego 👋

I'm a Data Analytics intern transitioning into Data Science and Fraud Analytics, with strong interest in applying data-driven solutions to real-world financial risk problems.

Currently working with SQL and analytical investigations, I focus on:

- Fraud detection analysis
- Behavioral pattern identification
- Model evaluation for imbalanced datasets (Recall & F1 focus)
- Business-oriented interpretation of machine learning metrics

## Technical Skills
- SQL (analytical queries, aggregation, window functions)
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn)
- Machine Learning evaluation
- Model performance metrics (Precision, Recall, F1)
- Data investigation and business reasoning

## Current Focus
- Fraud detection modeling
- Risk-based segmentation
- Performance monitoring for imbalanced classification
- Translating technical findings into business insights

Always learning, building, and improving through practical case studies.
